/*
~~RECURSION STACK ?
  1. Memory Allocation: Recursive calls add frames to the call stack for variables and return points.
  2. Growth with Depth: Deeper recursion equals more stack space.
  3. Base Case: Essential to limit recursion depth and prevent stack overflow.
  4. Stack Overflow Risk: Excessive recursion depth can crash the program.
  5. Tail Recursion Optimization: Can reduce stack usage for certain recursive patterns.
  6. Efficiency: Iterative solutions may be more stack-efficient than recursion for some problems.
