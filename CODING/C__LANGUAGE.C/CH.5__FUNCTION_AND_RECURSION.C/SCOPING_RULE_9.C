/*
~~SCOPING RULE
  1. Local Scope: Variables inside functions are local, not accessible outside.
  2. Global Scope: Variables outside functions are global, accessible anywhere in the file.
  3. Block Scope: Variables in blocks (like if or loops) are accessible only within those blocks.
  4. Function Parameters: Act as local variables within the function.
  5. Lifetime: Local variables exist during function execution only.
