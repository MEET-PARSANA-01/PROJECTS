~~WHAT IS STACK ?
  1. LIFO: Last-In, First-Out operation; the last element added is the first to be removed.
  2. Operations: Mainly push (add an item) and pop (remove an item).
  3. Top Element: Only the top element is accessible at any time, not the middle or bottom ones.
  4. Overflow and Underflow: Overflow when full, underflow when empty during operations.
