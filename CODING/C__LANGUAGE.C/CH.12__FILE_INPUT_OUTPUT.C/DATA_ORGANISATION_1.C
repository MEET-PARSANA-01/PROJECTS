/*
A.DATA ORGANISATION
   1. RAM (Random Access Memory): Volatile memory for temporary data storage while a computer is running.
   2. ROM (Read-Only Memory): Non-volatile memory used primarily to store firmware.
   3. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs): Mechanical, magnetic storage devices for long-term data retention.
   4. Solid-State Drives (SSDs): Fast, non-volatile storage devices that use flash memory.
   5. Cache Memory: A small, speedy volatile memory in CPUs or between CPU and RAM to store frequent data.
   6. Virtual Memory: Part of a hard drive used as RAM for extending physical memory, albeit slower.
   7. Flash Memory: Non-volatile memory used in USB drives and memory cards for portability.
   8. Optical Storage: Media like CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs for laser read data storage.


   1. Simplicity: C library functions provide a simple interface for file operations,hiding complex OS details.
   2. Portability: Programs use the same library calls regardless of the underlying OS, enhancing code portability.
   3. Standardization: The C Standard Library ensures consistent behavior across different environments.
   4. Ease of Use: Developers can perform file operations without knowing OS specific system calls.
   5. Abstraction: The library acts as an abstraction layer, managing OS interactions and disk I/O seamlessly.
