/*
D.FILE POINTER
  1. Variable Type: A file pointer is of type FILE * and is used to reference a file.
  2. Standard Files: C automatically provides file pointers like stdin, stdout, and stderr.
  3. Opening Files: File pointers are associated with a file on disk through the fopen function.
  4. Reading/Writing: They are used for reading from or writing to files with functions like fread, fwrite, fprintf, fscanf, etc.
  5. Position Tracking: Keeps track of the current position within the file for read/write operations.
  6. Closing Files: Should be passed to fclose to close the file and release resources.
