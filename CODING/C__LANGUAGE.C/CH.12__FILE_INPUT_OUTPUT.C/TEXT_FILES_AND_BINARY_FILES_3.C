C.TEXT FILES AND BINARY FILES
   1. Encoding: Text files store data in human-readable format while binary files store data in the same format as the in-memory representation.
   2. Data Interpretation: Text files represent data as characters, whereas binary files represent data as a sequence of bytes.
   3. Portability: Text files are more portable across different platforms. Binary files can be platform specific due to different data representations.
   4. Efficiency: Binary files are generally more efficient for I/O operations because they don't require translation.
