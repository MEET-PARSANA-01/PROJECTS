/*
~~CONTINUE STATEMENT
   1. Continue is used to skip one iteration or the current iteration
   2. Next Iteration: Immediately starts the next iteration of the loop.
   3. In while loop remember to do the increment manually before using continue.
   4. Used in Loops: Works within for, while, do while loops.
   5. Not for switch: Unlike break, not used in switch statements.
   6. Improves Logic: Helps in avoiding nested conditions within loops.
