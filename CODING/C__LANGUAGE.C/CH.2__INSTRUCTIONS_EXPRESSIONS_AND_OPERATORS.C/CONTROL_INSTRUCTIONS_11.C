/*
~~CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS
  Control Instructions enable us to specify the order in which various instructions in a program are executed.

  1. Sequence Control: Executes instructions in the order they're written.
  2. Selection Control: Chooses which instructions to run based on a condition (e.g., `if-else`).
  3. Loop Control: Repeats instructions until a condition changes (e.g., `for`,`while`).
  4. Case Control: Executes instructions from multiple options based on a variable's value (e.g., `switch`).
