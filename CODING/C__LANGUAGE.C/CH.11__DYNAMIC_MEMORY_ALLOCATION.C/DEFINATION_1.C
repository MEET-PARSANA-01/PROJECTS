/*
A.WHAT IS DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION
   1. Flexibility: Allocate memory as needed at runtime, accommodating variable data size requirements.
   2. Efficiency: Use only the memory necessary,releasing it when no longer needed, which can be more efficient than static allocation.
   3. Data Persistence: Memory allocated dynamically persists beyond the scope it was created in, until it is explicitly freed.
   4. Large Data: Enables handling of large data sets that might exceed the stack size, avoiding stack overflow.
   5. Data Structures: Essential for complex data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs where the size is not known at compile time.
