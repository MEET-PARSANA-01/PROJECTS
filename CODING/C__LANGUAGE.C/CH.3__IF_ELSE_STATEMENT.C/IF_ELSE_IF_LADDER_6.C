/*
~~IF ELSE IF LADDER
  1. Sequential Checking: The if-else ladder checks multiple conditions one after the other, from top to bottom.
  2. First True Condition: Executes the block of code associated with the first true condition it encounters.
  3. Exits After Execution: Once a true condition's code block is executed, it exits the ladder and skips the remaining conditions.
  4. Fallback with Else: If none of the conditions are true, the final else block (if present) executes as a default case.
