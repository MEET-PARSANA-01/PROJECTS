/*
~~SWITCH VS IF ELSE
   1. Scope of Comparison: switch tests equality for one variable; if-else can evaluate complex conditions.
   2. Float expression cannot be tested using a switch.
   3. Multiple cases cannot use same expressions.
   4. Readability: switch is cleaner for many discrete values; if-else is more versatile.
   5. Performance: switch might be faster for many cases due to compiler optimizations.
   6. Fall-through: switch allows case fall-through; if-else executes only one matched block.
